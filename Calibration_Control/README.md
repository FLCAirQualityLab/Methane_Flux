This folder contains LabVIEW scripts for use in the calibration apparatus developed as part of the CH4 (Methane) Flux Chamber Project conducted by the Casey Air Quality Lab at Fort Lewis College. The calibration apparatus controls gas concentration, relative humidity, and temperature for the purpose of calibrating low-cost sensors to quantify methane flux. The relevance of the primary files is detailed below.

# Calibration_Control Structure

Alicat_Sub-VIs: LabVIEW scripts supporting the control of Alicat MFCs, provided by Alicat
Control_Current_Version: The most recent version of the LabVIEW control script which is used for controlling the calibration apparatus autonomously
Control_Previous_Version: Previous versions of the LabVIEW calibration control script which lack the most recent features and functionality
Proprietary_Sub-VIs: LabVIEW scripts used in the control script for various features
Temp_Control: LabVIEW scripts used for the development of temperature control via serial communications with a Thermo Fisher Scientific TF-5000 chiller

# Notable Files and Scripts
Users will generally only need to use the current version of the control script. Previous versions may be useful if the current version is not currently functional.
